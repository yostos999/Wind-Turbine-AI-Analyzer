## Introduction

Wind energy is a vital component of the renewable energy landscape. As we shift towards more sustainable practices, understanding the performance of wind turbines becomes crucial. The **Wind Turbine AI Analyzer** leverages artificial intelligence to provide insights that enhance operational efficiency. This tool helps production engineers monitor performance, predict issues, and make informed decisions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilize advanced algorithms to analyze turbine data and provide actionable insights.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate reports automatically, saving time and effort for engineers.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipate potential failures and maintenance needs before they occur.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, making it easy to navigate and use.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies to deliver a robust analysis tool:

- **AI and Machine Learning**: For predictive analytics and data interpretation.
- **Gemini API**: To facilitate seamless data integration.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly web application.
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
